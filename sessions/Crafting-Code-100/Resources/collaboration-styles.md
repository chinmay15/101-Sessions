# Collaboration Styles

Here's a couple of collaboration styles that we can use to make sure everyone in the group is engaged and contributing. 

They should be suitable for both pairing and mobbing.

## Ping-Pong

Using the red -> green -> refactor steps of TDD:

1. Person A writes the first failing test
1. Person B makes the test past
1. Person A refactors the code
1. Person B writes the next failing test
1. continue going back and forth, building out the code

In the case where `number of participants % 3 === 0` ie each person could end up doing the same step each turn, use something to randomise the person who starts on each cycle.

## Driver/Navigator

1. Set a timer ([25 minutes is a good start](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique))
1. Designate a Driver - this person is only allowed to type. They can ask questions about syntax, naming etc
1. The other person(s) is the Navigator, they devise the solution, and tell the Driver what to type
1. When the timer finishes, take a break, and swap roles.

When mobbing, have one Driver, and the rest are Navigating. You may need a Facilitator to make sure everyone is adhering to the constraints and people are not dominating the conversation.<!--  -->
