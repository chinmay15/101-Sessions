# Pairing Styles

## Ping-Pong

Using the red -> green -> refactor steps of TDD:

1. Person A writes the first failing test
1. Person B makes the test past
1. Person A refactors the code
1. Person B writes the next failing test
1. continue going back and forth, building out the code

## Driver/Navigator

1. Set a timer ([25 minutes is a good start](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique))
1. Designate a Driver - this person is only allowed to type. They can ask questions about syntax, naming etc
1. The other person(s) is the Navigator, they devise the solution, and tell the Driver what to type
1. When the timer finishes, take a break, and swap roles.
