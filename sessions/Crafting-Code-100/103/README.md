# Code Smells and Safe Refactoring

Faced with a mess of spaghetti code, it is often difficult to know where to start. Fortunately, there are a number of common issues or `smells` that we can identify, that can target to start making our code more readable and malleable. Having identified these `code smells` we can apply specific `refactorings` - often via our IDE - to safely change our code, ensuring we keep things working.

## Benefits of the approach

* Relax in the reassuring warmth of green tests, safe in the knowledge that our code works as expected
* Develop an ubiquitous language to talk about our code and how we change it
* Make our IDE do the work, and make changes quickly and safely

## Task

We'll work through [Emily Bache's Tennis Refactoring repo](https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata), to make one of the existing solutions easier to work with.

We'll use the [driver/navigator pairing style](../Resources/pairing-styles.md) to refactor the chosen solution.

* Select one of the 3 solution files in the directory
* Run the tests so they run on saving the file
* Identify a code smell, and refactor it out, identifying to your partner which refactoring you are using, or describing what it is doing eg "rename variable", or "extract function"
* Continue to refactor until you are both happy with the code

### Getting Started

1. Navigate into the directory with the language of your choice
1. Install any dependencies]
