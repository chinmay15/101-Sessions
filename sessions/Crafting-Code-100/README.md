# Crafting Code 100

A collection of sessions to explore ways of improving the way we design and deliver our code, to save our future selves from a headache.

These sessions have been run previously over 2 hours, with a quick intro, 2 x pairing session and guidance, then ending with a quick debrief. They could be reduced down to an hour, or combined to make it an all-dayer/course. More suggestions in the [Facilitators readme](./Resources/facilitators-README.md).

## Sessions

- [101 - About Code Katas and TDD](./101/)
- [102 - TDD as if you meant it](./102/)
- [103 - Code Smells and Safe Refactorings](./103/)

## Potential Sessions

- DDD
- CRC Cards
- Mocking (don't mock all the things!)
- Outside In/Inside Out
- SOLID (an awareness of)
- OOP vs FP
- CUPID
- Tell, don't ask
- no ifs (declarative, over imperative)
- no keyboard (learn your IDE!)
- golden master
- saff-squeeze

## Useful resources
