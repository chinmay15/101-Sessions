# 101.4 Mutations

Applications need some way of making changes to the data thatâ€™s stored in the backend
Mutations

Mutations follow the same syntactical structure as queries but they always need to start with the mutation keyword
server interprets arguments

To form a mutation, you must specify three things:

- Mutation name: the type of modification you want to perform
- Input object: the data you want to send to the server, composed of input fields.
- Payload object: the data you want to return from the server

## Getting Started

Add a `Mutation` type to your schema to add a new user. The mutation will accept name, image and
companyName as arguments:

```
type Mutation {
  newUser(name: String, image: String, companyName: String): User
}
```

Add a resolver for our Mutation:

```
Mutation: {
  newUser: (parents, args, context, info) => {
    const { name, image, companyName } = args;
    const user = {
      id: users.length + 1,
      name
    };
    users.push(user);
    return user;
  }
}
```

The resolver will add a new user to our list of users and return the new user that has
just been created.


## Playground example

```
mutation { 
  newUser(
    name: "George", 
    image: "https://example.com/image", 
    companyName: "1"
  ),
  {
    id, name, image
  }
}
```


```
{
  "data": {
    "newUser": {
      "id": "5",
      "name": "George",
      "image": "https://example.com/image"
    }
  }
}
```
