# Creating resources

You can either use worksheets in the GUI or execute SQL commands with the CLI tool SnowSQL, which we will come on to later.


## Creating users [[docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-user.html)]

A 'user' is user identity recognized by Snowflake, whether associated with a real person or program.

Try running:

```USE ROLE SECURITYADMIN;```


Now we have adopted the security admin role, we will create users and roles.

```CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS JohnnyLawrence password='superSecretPass' default_role = PUBLIC must_change_password = true;```

The Snowflake docs will provide a list of all arguments you can pass on user creation, for example including a user's email address, though the above is enough to get started.


## Create roles [[docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-role.html)]

Snowflake uses roles to control the objects (virtual warehouses, databases, tables, etc.) that users can access:
* Snowflake provides a set of predefined roles, as well as a framework for defining a hierarchy of custom roles.
* All Snowflake users are automatically assigned the predefined PUBLIC role, which enables login to Snowflake and basic object access.
* In addition to the PUBLIC role, each user can be assigned additional roles, with one of these roles designated as their default role. A userâ€™s default role determines the role used in the Snowflake sessions initiated by the user; however, this is only a default. Users can change roles within a session at any time.
* Roles can be assigned at user creation or afterwards.

```CREATE ROLE IF NOT EXISTS DATA_CONSUMER COMMENT = 'Role to access raw data';```

Take a look at all the system users and roles created so far:

List users:

```SHOW USERS;```

List roles:

```SHOW ROLES;```

> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Objects are not case sensitive unless "quoted". See [Identifier Requirements](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/identifiers-syntax.html) for more info around case sensitivity and allowed characters in Snowflake

### Assigning a role to a user

```GRANT ROLE DATA_CONSUMER TO USER JohnnyLawrence```

## Create databases [[docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-database.html)]

To instantiate resources like databases, you must adopt the `SYSADMIN` role:

```
USE ROLE SYSADMIN;
CREATE DATABASE RAW_DATA;
```

To enable roles to access the database we must grant permissions:

```GRANT USAGE, CREATE SCHEMA ON DATABASE RAW_DATA TO DATA_CONSUMER;```


## Create schemas [[docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-schema.html)]

```
USE DATABASE RAW_DATA;
CREATE SCHEMA SALES;
```

## Create tables [[docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/create-table.html)]

The format to create tables is:

```CREATE TABLE db_name.schame_name.table_name (col_1_name col_1_data_type, col_2_name col_1_data_type)```

We will consume JSON data and so choose the variant type which allows querying of semi-structured data.

```CREATE TABLE RAW_DATA.SALES.TRANSACTIONS (RAW_DATA VARIANT);```

## File formats [[docs](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/sql/show-file-formats.html)]

You can create custom file formats you wish to consume, it is worth noting for future table creation but for now we will use the defaults. File formats belong to a database and schema, you can retireve them using:

```SHOW FILE FORMATS```
