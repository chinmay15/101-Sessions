# Snowflake 101 - Creating a data warehouse

This 101 session can be guided or completed solo.

The learning aims are to build a Snowflake data warehouse from scratch which can ingest data from the local filesystem and AWS S3, and unload / export data as `.csv`.

The 102 covers how to connect Snowflake to AWS S3 for automated data ingestion.

The 103 covers how to deploy Snowflake through code using Terraform.

## [Why Snowflake?](https://kb.infinityworks.com/snowflake/)
Check out the knowledge base article on why we use it.

## Who should take this workshop?

Anyone interested in building a data warehouse with Snowflake, those wishing to integrate with AWS to extend their data platform and those who want to learn how to build a data platform using infrastructure as code with Terraform.

## Pre-requisites

### Experience
- Snowflake experience not required.
- AWS experience with S3, IAM roles and policies desirable but not essential; DynamoDB is a bonus.
- Working knowledge of Terraform is strongly preferred for the 102 but not essential.
- Working knowledge of Docker is preferred but not essential.

### Accounts
- Snowflake accounts
