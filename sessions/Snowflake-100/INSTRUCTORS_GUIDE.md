# Snowflake 101 - Instructors Guide

## Pre-session Checks

Ensure there are at least 2*N number of S3 buckets to people if using any shared AWS accounts. Each person must create a state bucket and data lake.

Each session should be delivered as a half day. There are too many concepts and moving parts to effectively teach and learn the 101 and 102 content in a single day.

The 101 is very manageable and can be completed in a single morning.

The 102 session is more complex and should be delivered to those who have already completed the 101 or have a reasonable experience level with Snowflake (in terms of creating resources) and ideally have a familiarity with an infrastructure as code tool.
